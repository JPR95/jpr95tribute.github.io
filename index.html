    <h3 >Here's a list of all Onix's failings:</h3>
    <ul id="tribute-info">
      <li><b>Unavailable until Rock Tunnel</b>, by which point you could have evolved a Geodude in Mt. Moon and evolved it into a Graveler.
      <li><b>Grass</b>- and <b>Water</b>-type attacks deal quadruple damage to Onix.
      <li><b>Fighting</b>-, <b>Ice</b>-, and <b>Ground</b>-type attacks deal double damage to Onix.
      <li><b>Base 35 HP</b> is tied with Dugtrio for the lowest of all fully-evolved Pokémon.
      <li><b>Base 45 Attack</b> is tied with Butterfree and Mr. Mime for the second lowest of all fully-evolved Pokémon, only outperforming Chansey. This Attack stat is tied many unevolved Pokémon, such as Pidgey, Jigglypuff, and Zubat.
      <li><b>Base 160 Defense</b> is the second highest of all fully evolved Pokémon, beating all but Cloyster. Onix actually has an impressive resistance against physical attacks. However, when combined with its low base HP, Onix still has less physical bulk than Golem and Rhydon.
      <li><b>Base 30 Special</b> is the lowest of all fully evolved Pokémon. Onix cannot perform special attacks to any note-worthy extent. Onix is also the most vulnerable Pokémon to special attacks.
      <li><b>Base 70 Speed</b> is perfectly average for a fully evolved Pokémon. It outspeeds Golem and Rhydon, but unfortunately it doesn't have the capability to take out anything that would threaten them.
      <li><b>Rock Throw</b> is the only move it learns through leveling up which gains STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus). It only has 50 base power and is only 65% accurate.
      <li><b>Rock Slide</b> and <b>Earthquake</b> are its best STAB moves, but they both require one-time use TMs to learn. They are both better spent on other Pokémon.
